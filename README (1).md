# Employee Information System

It's a small project when you can see employee
informations like, his/her name, lastname, phone number, 
city, email and annual salary. 


Also in this project you are able to edit employee 
informations, if there is any change.

Other feature is to delete the data. For example if 
any of the employees decide to leave, you can delete his/her 
informations.



## Created classes

Connect() - for connecting the netbeans to the database.
table_update() - storing the data into table.




## Lessons Learned

In this project I learn more about 
vector() class and DefaultTableModel() class.
What they are, and how they are used in a project.
